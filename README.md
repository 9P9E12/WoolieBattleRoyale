# WoolieBattleRoyale
A project I worked on that simulates two creatures called Woolies, read from a file in the data folder titled "woolies.txt", fighting in an arena by using threads. Included are the unaltered files and commits, which includes questions I posed to the SLI who graded these in an attempt to break up the monotony of looking at several projects and commits that all did the same thing
To run this program, simply download all the files and run the main function in WoolieBattleRoyale.java. If you wish to alter anything the file is meant to be utilized as follows:
The first line specifies how many arenas are in use at once
All following lines specify a woolie, the format is: Name,Lowest Possible Attack Value,Delay Between Attacks,Maximum Health
The program expects the data to be formatted properly, and crashes if the Delay Between Attacks is 0.
